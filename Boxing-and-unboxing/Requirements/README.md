# Boxing and Unboxing

Write a small console application that will demonstrate that boxing and unboxing are very efficient... or it was very inefficient?... It seems that I do not remember anymore.

Anyway, write a console application that highlights the performance of boxing and unboxing. We need to know if they bring any performance penalties. Is it safe to use them carelessly or should we be careful, and use them only when it is really needed?

We need this information because we have in our project a huge database (tens of millions of records) that we need to process.

Based on your analysis we will take a certain approach when designing our application.

Thank you ;)
